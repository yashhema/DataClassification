You are right to ask for an analysis first. I apologize for jumping to code in the previous response. Let's break down exactly what needs to be updated in `smb_connector.py` to support the new remediation capabilities.

Based on our recent changes to the system's interfaces and data models, the `smb_connector.py` file now has two main areas that require updates: **interface compliance** and **handling new task types**.

---
### 1. Interface Compliance: Implementing Remediation Actions

This is the most significant and immediate change required. The `IFileDataSourceConnector` interface, which `SMBConnector` implements, now includes the new `IRemediationConnector` interface. This means the `SMBConnector` class is currently incomplete because it's missing the required methods for post-scan actions.

**What Needs to Be Updated:**

You need to add the following four `async` methods to the `SMBConnector` class to satisfy the interface contract:

* `move_objects(self, source_paths: List[str], destination_directory: str, context: Dict[str, Any]) -> RemediationResult`
* `delete_objects(self, paths: List[str], context: Dict[str, Any]) -> RemediationResult`
* `create_tombstones(self, paths: List[str], finding_summary: str, context: Dict[str, Any]) -> RemediationResult`
* `apply_encryption(self, paths: List[str], encryption_key_id: str, context: Dict[str, Any]) -> RemediationResult`

For each of these methods, you will need to implement the logic using the `smbprotocol` library to perform the actual file operations (rename for move, remove for delete, and write for tombstone).

### 2. Handling New `WorkPacket` Payloads

The `Worker` will receive new `WorkPacket`s with `TaskType`s like `REMEDIATION_MOVE`. The worker will then need to call the corresponding new method on the connector. To support this, the connector needs two minor updates:

#### A. Import the `RemediationResult` Model

The new remediation methods are required to return a `RemediationResult` object. You must update the imports at the top of the file to include this new model.

* **File Location**: `connectors/smb_connector.py`
* **Change**: Update the import from `core.models.models` to include `RemediationResult`.

#### B. Prepare for New Task Dispatch (Conceptual)

While the `Worker` is responsible for dispatching the tasks, the `SMBConnector` must be ready to receive them. The current file only has logic for handling discovery and classification. The implementation of the new interface methods (from point #1) will provide the entry points for the worker to call when it receives a remediation `WorkPacket`.

In summary, the core task is to **implement the four new remediation methods** required by the updated interface. This will involve using the "write" capabilities of the `smbprotocol` library and ensuring the methods correctly handle batches of files and return a `RemediationResult`.
